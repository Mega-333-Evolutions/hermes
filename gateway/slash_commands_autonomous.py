"""Gateway /autonomous command: owner-only, DM-only autonomous mode switch.

Idle-only (``busy_policy="reject"`` in the registry): flipping the mode
mid-run would change the running turn's caps and its cached agent; /stop is
the mid-run control, and after /stop the owner can enable/disable cleanly.

Gating, in order, ALL SILENT on failure: Telegram only, DM only (the chat
is the actor's own DM), owner only. A non-owner / non-DM caller gets no
message, no reaction, and no log line naming the mode.
