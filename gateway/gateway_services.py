"""Shared store for the F9b-e gateway service layer (boards, portals, nodes).

Services keep their state in the home's ``state.db`` ``state_meta`` KV table
(``SessionDB.get_meta``/``set_meta``) — no new table, no new file, no new
database. Keys are namespaced ``gateway.<service>.<id>`` and values are JSON.
That is the same store the scheduler and kanban retag use for service
bookkeeping, and it survives restarts with the rest of Hermes state.

The OpenClaw layer this ports keeps its registries in memory
(``node-registry.ts:143`` in-memory maps; the board store is per-session
memory behind the gateway). Hermes adds the ``state_meta`` write-through so
a board, portal allocation or paired node survives a gateway restart; the
live computation rule from F9a still holds — nothing here is a *snapshot*
store for presence, and ``connected``/``lastSeen`` on nodes is derived from
recorded invoke activity, not a polled liveness table.
