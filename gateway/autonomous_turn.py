"""Per-turn autonomous wiring for the gateway runner (``TurnRunner`` collaborator).

The runner calls these around a turn; the state itself lives in
``gateway/autonomous_state.py`` (run store + live flag) and the per-turn
flag in ``agent/autonomous_context.py`` (contextvar). This module owns the
seams between them and the turn:

- :func:`begin` — read the live flag + run record at turn start; evict the
  cached agent when the flag flipped since that agent was built
  (cached-agent trap: construction bakes in ``model_config`` state, and the
  config signature does not cover the autonomous flag, so a flip must bust
  the cache or the turn silently reuses the wrong agent).
- :func:`stamp_run_model` — stamp the turn's resolved model onto the run
  record, the same stamping the aborted-turn code does
  (``turn_model_from_agent``), so a model change starts fresh, never resumes
  under the wrong model.
- :func:`maybe_prepend_start_message` — the one run-start line, once per
  run, as ordinary conversation content (prepended to the user message, so
  it is persisted in the transcript and visible to the owner). Zero prompt
  bytes: no system-prompt, prompt-builder or toolset change anywhere here.
- :func:`arm_conversation` / :func:`disarm_conversation` — the per-turn
  bypass around ``run_conversation``: the contextvar, the
  ``tools/approval`` per-key session set, and the run-budget override.
  ``run_budget_seconds`` is checked and ignored while the flag is on, so an
  owner-set wall clock cannot kill a run; the previous value is restored
  afterwards, so a cached agent's budget survives the turn.
- :func:`install_tool_checkpoint` / :func:`checkpoint_tool` — checkpoint
  the run record after each completed tool call (hence after each completed
  tool round): steps, last tool, and the run's token totals. Best-effort —
  a failed checkpoint is logged, never raised into the turn.
- :func:`observe_watchdog` — feed the same completed tool call to the
  run's watchdog (``agent/autonomous_watchdog.py``): on a stuck episode it
  records the one-shot agent note, bumps the run's stall count, and hops
  the owner status + throttled pinned update onto the gateway loop. The
  watchdog observes only — it never blocks, halts, or caps the turn.

Per-turn state rides the ``TurnRunner`` instance (it is built per turn);
class-level defaults on ``TurnRunner`` keep the seams working on instances
built without ``__init__`` (``TurnRunner.__new__`` in tests). Nothing here
touches the prompt, taint refusals, admission, or runtime self-protection.
