"""Generalised launch idempotency for agent-internal and cron launches.

OpenClaw shape (``src/gateway/server-methods/session-create-idempotency.ts``):
caller-supplied ``idempotencyKey`` + sha256 request-identity hash + in-flight
join + TTL replay, bounded by ``DEDUPE_MAX``. Hermes already had the durable
half for ``POST /v1/runs`` (``RunIdempotencyStore``); this module is the
reusable other half: any launcher reserves ``(scope, key)`` once, joins an
in-flight duplicate in this process, replays a terminal outcome inside
retention, and gets a conflict when the same key arrives with a different
request identity. A failed run releases its reservation, so a retry can run
it again — the same rule OpenClaw applies (failed entries are released, only
successful ones become replayable).

Cross-process duplicates cannot join a live run they cannot see, so a reused
non-terminal reservation whose owner is provably dead is adopted (the caller
re-reserves after forgetting the stale row), while one whose owner is alive
is reported ``running`` and the caller must not start a second run.

The store is constructed per ``LaunchIdempotency``, never cached at module
level: under multiplexing the owning home is bound per activity
(``gateway/AGENTS.md``), and a module-global store would freeze the launch
profile's home.
