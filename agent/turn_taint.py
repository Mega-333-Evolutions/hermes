"""Per-turn taint state (OpenClaw shape: ``turn-taint-state.ts``).

A turn is tainted once any tool outcome carries network-sourced content — a web
search/extract result, a browser page, an MCP tool result. Taint is sticky for
the turn and resets at the next turn's start. Hermes has no ``presentationOnly``
tool-result concept, so every network-sourced result taints.

The one consumer that ports without invention is memory-write provenance: a write on a
tainted turn is stamped ``origin_class: "untrusted"``, else ``"agent"``
(``turn_taint_origin_class`` below — the taint half of the full resolver in
``agent/memory_model.py::resolve_memory_origin_class``, which adds the ``system`` class
for non-interactive write origins). OpenClaw's other consumers do not port: Hermes has
no owner-only model tools (admission is gateway-level, and inventing an owner-tool
denial would be a new limit), no decision prefilter, and no transcript consumer.

The three refusals below are the enforcement half (wave 5). They are PROVISIONAL —
proposed and approved provisionally 2026-11-11, and the user will change them later;
build as proposed, do not extend them. A tainted turn:

- cannot spend credentials/secrets (``refuse_tainted_vault_spend`` — the vault
  fill/enter_code spend; provider keys for the agent's own inference and read-tool
  API keys are NOT spends under this ruling, because a tainted turn can still
  read and answer the user, and both need their keys),
- cannot approve things (``refuse_tainted_auto_approve`` — the two places the agent
  itself grants approval: ``suggest_task``'s autonomous auto-approve and the
  delegated child's auto-approve callback; the owner approving on a card is the
  owner acting, not the turn, and is untouched),
- cannot send messages to other chats (``refuse_tainted_cross_chat_send`` for tools
  that always send elsewhere; ``refuse_tainted_telegram_send`` for ``telegram_client``
  actions, where a numeric send to the current chat stays allowed and every other
  recipient is refused).

Enforcement lives in the tool handlers, at the point of effect, where the action,
the target and the current chat are all in scope. Handlers receive the agent as
``parent_agent`` (threaded through ``model_tools.handle_function_call`` from the
turn-loop dispatchers); a handler called with no agent (out-of-turn callers: MCP
server, code kernel, eval harnesses) sees no turn and no taint, so the helpers
fail open on ``agent=None``. A refused call returns a tool error and never runs;
a refusal never itself taints the turn.

State lives on the agent instance (``agent._turn_taint``), lazily created —
following the existing per-turn agent-attribute pattern (``_turn_user_intervened``)
and avoiding ContextVar thread-propagation issues in the concurrent executor.
