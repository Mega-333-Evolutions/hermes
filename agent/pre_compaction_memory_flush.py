"""Pre-compaction memory flush (OpenClaw flush-plan shape, adapted to Hermes).

Before a compaction summarizes the transcript away, a bounded review fork extracts the
durable facts from the messages about to be compacted and writes them into the built-in
MemoryStore (MEMORY.md / USER.md) — not just into the summary prompt, where they would
survive only as prose inside the compressed handoff.

The flush reuses the background-review machinery (``agent/background_review.py``): same
fork, same memory-only prompt, same tool whitelist (memory add-only). It differs in
three ways:

- it runs synchronously, under the compression lease, BEFORE the summary is generated,
  and waits for the fork only up to a bounded join timeout;
- its write origin is ``compaction_flush``, so its writes resolve to provenance class
  ``system`` (``agent/memory_model.py``);
- its input applies the promotion origin gate deterministically: tool results from
  network-sourced tools are dropped from the fork's input, so a fact that exists only
  in web/search/browser content can never promote into durable memory
  (``agent/memory_model.py::is_promotion_origin_blocked`` at the input level).

Best-effort throughout: no store, a detached fork, ``skip_background_review``, a review
already in flight, a flush timeout, or any flush error all skip or abandon the flush and
let compression continue unchanged.
