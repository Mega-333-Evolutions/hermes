"""Callback-query answers that survive a tap on an expired Telegram card.

Telethon port of upstream's PTB-shaped ``callback_answer`` (new in the
v0.23.x gap): the behaviour is identical, the transport is MTProto —
no ``telegram`` (python-telegram-bot) import anywhere in this file.

Telegram refuses ``SetBotCallbackAnswer`` once the query is older than its
window (``QUERY_ID_INVALID``). The fork's handlers awaited
``event.answer()`` unguarded, so a tap on a card that had been sitting in
the chat raised out of the handler: the outer ``except`` in
``TelethonAdapter._on_callback_query`` only debug-logs it, whatever the
handler had left to do never ran (a model switch kept its picker state,
since the pop sits after the toast), and the tap produced no feedback at
all. Verified against installed Telethon 1.45.0:
``CallbackQuery.Event.answer()`` sends ``SetBotCallbackAnswerRequest``
and raises ``telethon.errors.rpcerrorlist.QueryIdInvalidError`` on an
expired query; a second answer is a silent no-op via the event's
``_answered`` flag.

``answer_callback`` is the one choke point for those answers. A refused
answer is reported as ``False`` instead of raising. ``answer_or_note``
covers taps on a menu that has already expired — the one case where the
toast was the only thing the user would have seen, and "Picker expired —
use /model again." is still a usable next step as a normal message, posted
in the chat and forum topic the card lives in (via the adapter's normal
``send``; the fork has no ``_send_control_message``). Every other error
keeps raising: a broken answer must stay visible.

Wiring (not done here — ``telethon_adapter.py`` is owned by the sync
coordinator): replace the unguarded ``await event.answer(...)`` calls in
``TelethonAdapter._on_callback_query`` and
``hm_action_callbacks.handle_hm_action_callback`` with
``await answer_callback(event, ...)``, and use ``answer_or_note`` for
expired-menu taps (model picker / sessions pages) so the user still gets
the next step as a chat message.
