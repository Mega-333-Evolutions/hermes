"""GuestBot settings and status messages for the Telegram MTProto adapter.

Kept out of ``telethon_adapter.py`` (already over the file-size cap): the
profile-persisted GuestBot toggle and the per-turn status message live here;
the adapter keeps thin delegates so existing call sites are unchanged.

Guest turns never stream: there is no guest draft sink (removed 2026-11-07 —
guestbot cannot send a typing indicator; the draft never worked live). The
"Thinking…" status message, edited in place with the answer, is the feedback.
