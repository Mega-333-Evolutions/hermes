"""Live draft demos for /draft (topics 2 and 6): behaviour contracts.

The demos drive the REAL ``ResponseStreamDraft`` sink against a fake
MTProto client that records every request, so the frame sequence is
observed on the wire shape — placeholder text draft, italic Thinking
reasoning draft, rich content draft, sync draft — and the final message
goes out as a real ``SendMessageRequest``. No demo frame is ever a sent
message.

The injected ``sleep`` stands in for the production frame delay: it
records the delay the demo asked for and waits for the frame that
preceded it to land (event-based, via ``async_wait_until``), never for
the clock — the sink's own 1 s trailing-edge throttle still paces the
frames, as in production.
