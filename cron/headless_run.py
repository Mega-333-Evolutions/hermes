"""Run this headless with a runId: the generic headless-run entry point.

Other subsystems invoke the scheduler without owning a stored cron job:
``run_headless(run_id=..., prompt=..., ...)`` runs one ad-hoc agent turn
through the shared ``run_one_job`` seam (execution ledger, detached-worker
handoff, fire-claim delivery fence, delivery queue) and returns whether the
run was processed. The run is keyed by ``run_id`` through
``gateway.platforms.launch_idempotency``: a repeated call with the same
``run_id`` and the same spec joins or replays instead of running twice; the
same ``run_id`` with a different spec is a conflict and raises.

The delivery fence is NOT re-implemented here. Hermes already holds
occurrence authority in ``_FireOwnership`` (``cron/scheduler.py:2979``):
the fire claim is re-validated before every side effect
(``side_effect_fence`` / ``lost``) and is never serialized into the delivery
payload or the queue row — only job JSON + content cross that boundary,
which is the OpenClaw fence's "host-held occurrence authority, never
serialized" rule in Hermes' own shape. ``run_headless`` reuses that fence
by going through ``run_one_job`` instead of building a second one.

The run executes under the caller's ambient profile scope (the ticker binds
``_profile_cron_scope``, the gateway binds its runtime scope before calling
in); ``run_headless`` binds no scope itself, exactly like ``run_one_job``.
