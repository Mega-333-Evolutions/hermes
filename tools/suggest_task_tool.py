"""F7 ``suggest_task`` / ``dismiss_task`` — operator-approved follow-up suggestions.

OpenClaw port (``src/agents/tools/task-suggestion-tools.ts``): the model
suggests a follow-up (title ≤60 chars, prompt ≤32 KB, tldr), gets a
``task_id`` back, and the follow-up starts only when the operator approves
the card. Hermes shape of the same contract:

- **Pending-suggestion store** — one JSON record per suggestion under
  ``<home>/pending/suggestions/<task_id>.json`` (0700 dir, 0600 file,
  ``atomic_json_write``), the same layout ``tools/write_approval.py`` stages
  pending memory/skill writes in. The record is the audit trail: status
  moves ``pending → approved → started`` (or ``pending → denied``), and
  ``dismiss_task`` deletes a pending record.
- **Card / approval presentation** — the suggestion is presented through
  Hermes' existing approvals machinery, not a new gate: the tool blocks in
  ``tools.approval_gateway_wait._await_gateway_decision`` with the session's
  registered gateway notify callback — the same wait the terminal guard
  uses. The runner renders it as a native approval card on adapters that
  have one (Telegram: ``TelethonAdapter._send_exec_approval_prompt``,
  inline Approve-once / Deny buttons, owner-only taps) and as plain text
  with ``/approve`` steps elsewhere. Only Approve-once / Deny are offered
  (``allow_permanent=False, allow_session=False``): a suggestion is a
  one-shot, never a standing grant. The wait is bounded by
  ``approvals.timeout`` (default 300 s); silence is not consent — a
  timeout leaves the suggestion pending in the store, and the card is
  edited in place to a timed-out notice by the runner's settle hook.
  A tap or ``/approve`` resolves the wait; ``/deny <reason>`` relays the
  reason verbatim.
- **Approver = owner only.** The card metadata stamps the turn's owner
  (``run_turn_runner._render_approval_sync``) and the adapter denies
  non-owner taps; ``/approve`` resolves only for a subscriber holding
  ``session:approve``.
- **Follow-up start** — an approved suggestion starts as a delegate child
  run carrying the suggested prompt, through the agent's own
  ``_dispatch_delegate_task`` call site (same depth / spawn-pause / routing
  / budget gates as a model-called ``delegate_task``; top-level runs start
  in the background and re-enter on completion, a delegated child stays
  synchronous). OpenClaw starts a new session; Hermes has no
  session-create tool primitive, so the delegate child run — its own
  session id, listed in ``agents_list`` — is the port's equivalent. The
  record is re-read before the spawn, so a suggestion dismissed while the
  card was waiting is never started.
- **Autonomous mode bypass** — the user's ruling (2026-11-11): approval-gated
  normally, but autonomous mode takes NO approvals — guard-free, runs
  infinity, suggestions auto-run. The bypass lives behind the single seam
  :func:`_autonomous_mode_enabled`, wired to the runner's per-turn
  autonomous flag (``agent/autonomous_context.py``). When it returns True,
  ``suggest_task`` records the suggestion as auto-approved and starts the
  follow-up at once: no card, no wait, no approval.
- **No card available** (cron, batch, a surface with no gateway notify):
  the suggestion is staged and returned as pending — never silently
  committed, never silently dropped — with the reason, so the model can
  re-present it in a session with a human or dismiss it.

The store is per profile home (``get_hermes_home()`` at call time): one
process serves many profiles, and a suggestion belongs to the profile
whose turn suggested it.
